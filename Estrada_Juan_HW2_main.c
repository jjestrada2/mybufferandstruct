* Description: In the main function, command-line arguments are 
used to populate a personalInfo structure with personal details, 
such as the first and last name, student ID, grade level, knowl-
edge of various programming languages, and a message. These deta-
ils are then written using the writePersonalInfo function. The 
program proceeds to allocate a buffer and processes a series of 
strings obtained from the getNext function. It copies these strings
into the buffer, ensuring that the buffer does not exceed a specified 
block size. When the buffer is full or all strings have been 
processed, it commits the data using the commitBlock function. 
The final step is to call the checkIt function to validate the
stored personal information. After freeing allocated memory, 
the function returns an exit code based on the success of the 
checkIt function, providing feedback on the execution of the program.
